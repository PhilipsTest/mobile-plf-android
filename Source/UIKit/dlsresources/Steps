Steps to generate theme using JSON
1. Copy the jsons from
https://bitbucket.atlas.philips.com/projects/DLSUIT/repos/dls-resources/browse/json-source/colors
into <Repo>/uid-android/Source/UIKit/dlsresources/src/main/resources
This will be added as a submodule later so as to avoid manual copy paste work

2. Run below command from your Source/CatalogApp folder
   ./gradlew dlsresources:generateThemesAndCopyXmls

   Capture the logs if you get any issue to inform Design team to work on the changes
    if something goes wrong

3. Run Tests in dlsresources, to make sure JSON are proper
   ./gradlew dlsresources:test
4. Build app and run now
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ./gradlew installDebug

    <string name="guards_environment">Guards your environment</string>
    <string name="indoor_pollutants_intro">World Health Organization (WHO) studies show that indoor air is often 10-30 times more polluted than outdoor air. Our homes are threatened by many air pollutants.</string>
    <string name="indoor_pollutants_subheading">Main indoor pollutants</string>
    <string name="pollutant_heading_1">Formaldehyde</string>
    <string name="pollutant_heading_2">Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs)</string>
    <string name="pollutant_heading_3">Airborne pathogens</string>
    <string name="pollutant_heading_4">Pet hair and dust mites</string>
    <string name="pollutant_heading_5">Outdoor particulates</string>
    <string name="pollutant_heading_6">Particulate matter (PM) 2.5</string>
    <string name="pollutant_intro_1">A colourless gas released from paints, solvents and adhesives found in furniture and wood products. It is irritant and a known carcinogen, forming serious health risk with prolonged exposure.</string>
    <string name="pollutant_intro_2">TVOCs are harmful gas emitting from cleaning agents, disinfectants and paints. They include toluene, benzene, xylene, higher alkenes and aldehydes.</string>
    <string name="pollutant_intro_3">Bacteria, fungi (moulds) and viruses are all present in indoor air. Bacteria cause coughs, colds and more serious illnesses like tuberculosis.</string>
    <string name="pollutant_intro_4">Pet hair and dust mites gather on the floor and carpet. Pet hair may cause allergies of the eyes and airways while dust mites often trigger allergies and asthma.</string>
    <string name="pollutant_intro_5">Yellow dust, fine dust and pollen can cause allergies and various respiratory diseases. One of the biggest problems with indoor air quality is outdoor air.</string>
    <string name="pollutant_intro_6">Particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM 2.5) can penetrate and settle in the deepest parts of the lungs and cause cardiac disease and other cardiovascular health problems. They stay a long time in the atmosphere, travel long distances and pose serious health risks.</string>
    <string name="vistashield_ips_system_intro">At the core of Philips VitaShield IPS technology is a leading multi-faceted active filtration system. With layers of meticulously designed filters, the system guards your health against almost all indoor air pollutants.</string>
    <string name="vistashield_ips_system_subheading">Four-tiered filtration for 4 times the protection</string>
    <string name="vistashield_heading_1">1. Sieving </string>
    <string name="vistashield_heading_2">2. Inertial impaction </string>
    <string name="vistashield_heading_3">3. Interception </string>
    <string name="vistashield_heading_4">4. Diffusion and absorption</string>
    <string name="vistashield_intro_1">Particles with a diameter wider than 1 micrometre are blocked by the filter.</string>
    <string name="vistashield_intro_2">Particles with a diameter wider than 0.5 micron stick to the filter during their airborne inertial motion.</string>
    <string name="vistashield_intro_3">Particles floating in the air current with a diameter between 0.1 and 0.5 micrometres are attracted to the filter by electrostatic forces.</string>
    <string name="vistashield_intro_4">Randomly absorbs fine particles that move erratically in the air. Removes harmful particulates less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter (PM 2.5).</string>
    <string name="vistashield_nanometer_ques">How fine is 20nm (nanometres)?</string>
    <string name="vistashield_performance_subheading">Low noise and high performance</string>
    <string name="vistashield_performance_intro">An advanced aerodynamic wind tunnel design and a hushed engine suck air in rapidly, even from far room corners. As air circulation is promoted, the purification process improves significantly.\nOptimised design improves airflow through the filters and the purifier can run at a lower speed to reduce noise.</string>
    <string name="guards_environment_subheading">Creates an allergy-free environment.</string>
    <string name="guards_environment_intro">Dust, pollen, pet dander, PM 2.5, mould spores and other airborne particles at home cause coughing, sneezing, red eyes, itchy nose, asthma, eczema and other allergic symptoms.\n\nThe Philips VitaShield IPS is certified by the European Centre for Allergy Research Foundation (ECARF) for its efficacy in easing allergies and creating a safe environment for those with allergies.</string>
    <string name="guards_environment_filter">The Philips VitaShield IPS\'s multi-level active filtration blocks up to 99.7% of airborne particles, preventing irritants from triggering allergic reactions.</string>
    <string name="guards_environment_monitoring_sensor">Intelligent sensors are constantly monitoring to ensure all-day protection.</string>
    <string name="guards_environment_ozone_emmission">Zero ozone emissions prevents further pollution and infection. </string>
    <string name="new_home_syndrome_heading">Say goodbye to \'new home syndrome\'.</string>
    <string name="new_home_syndrome_intro_part1" formatted="false">\'New home syndrome\' is spreading with urbanisation. Harmful and toxic gases such as formaldehyde and toluene are released into the air from synthetic construction and decorating materials. These pollutants can persist for four years after work has finished.\n\nUp to 50% of homes in China exceed the country\'s standard for formaldehyde content in air and up to 40% exceed the standard for TVOC.</string>
    <string name="new_home_syndrome_intro_part2">The Philips VitaShield IPS\'s New Home filter offers triple protection against \'new home syndrome\':</string>
    <string name="vistashield_features">1. Active carbon coating traps formaldehyde on the outside surface.\n\n2. Each gram of active carbon has a surface area of  around 1000m2. Many pollutants are filtered by this enormous surface area.\n\n3. Nano-pores are precisely positioned to block and collect hazardous gases.\n\nTest conducted in a 30M³ room reveal that almost all formaldehyde is removed after using the New Home filter for three hours.</string>

    <string name="airborne_disease_desc">Increasing population density, globalisation and drug resistance lead to high incidence of airborne disease. From workplaces to  public areas, we are getting more vulnerable to epidemic disease.\n\nThe Philips VitaShield IPS  traps pollutants down to a microscopic level of just 20 nanometres, removing bird flu and influenza virus, legionnella and other common pathogens.\n\nTest results indicate a reduction of 99.9% of bacteria and viruses within one hour of using the Philips VitaShield IPS</string>

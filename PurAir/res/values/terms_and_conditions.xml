We want you and others to enjoy our services, so please don’t use our Services in a way that is commonly considered inappropriate (such as obscene, violating laws and regulations, offensive, discriminatory or infringing someone else’s rights).\n\nUser Content is not provided by Philips, and we do not endorse opinions, recommendations, or advice expressed therein. When you share your content, we intend to use it for our own purposes as well, including for commercial purposes. If this is not what you would like, it is best to be cautious about what you share.\n\n\nThird Parties and Third Party Fees\n\n\nIt is possible that when you use the Services you will also use a service, download a piece of software, or purchase goods that are provided by a third party. Those third party services and products may have their own applicable rules and restrictions, separate from these Terms, and you need to abide by them in regard to that third party. \n\n\nYou acknowledge that you are responsible for all fees charged by third parties, such as your ISP or mobile device carrier, which provide you with specific requirements that enable you to use the Services.\n\n\nOwnership and Intellectual Property\n\n\nPhilips owns the copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and trade dress rights to all materials and content displayed on and from the Services. You may not reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, display, frame, perform, publish, distribute, disseminate, transmit, broadcast or circulate any such materials or content to any third party (including displaying or distributing the material using a third party website) without Philips’ prior written consent except to use the Services for their intended purposes.

HOWEVER DO KNOW THAT WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU THE SERVICES "AS-IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND THAT YOU CANNOT RELY ON THE TIMELINESS OR ANY OF THE RESULTS THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN FROM THE SERVICES. This is among others due to the fact that the availability of the Services is also dependent on external circumstances such as your computer, mobile device, home wiring, Wi-Fi network, your internet service provider and mobile device carrier upon which Philips has no influence. Therefore Philips cannot warrant in relation to the Services the: availability, uptime, accuracy of results, accuracy of data, storage of data, accessibility in all countries, reliability of any resulting notifications, any specific level of savings or other monetary benefit. \n\n\nThe air quality data measured by the Product and displayed through the Service is only intended to measure certain aspects of air quality in the immediate vicinity of the sensor measuring such air quality. Such data should not be relied upon for any purpose and should not be used to determine whether the air is safe to breath or whether any toxins are or are not present in the air.  \n\n\nLimitation of Liability\n\n\nAs much faith as we have in our Service, there is always the possibility that things don\'t work as they are supposed to. In the unfortunate event that the Service would not work or any content may be lost, please accept our sincerest apologies. We certainly understand that it is unfortunate and inconvenient. Unfortunately, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we cannot accept any liability for any damages incurred as a result of your use of the Services. IN ANY EVENT WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR AMOUNTS EXCEEDING THE FEES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES.\n\n\nGoverning Law\n\n\nThese conditions of use shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the laws of the Netherlands without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.\n\n

## Contributing via Pull Requests

To raise a pull request please follow the below steps

1. Clone the repository and create a branch based off of master.
2. The Naming convention for the branch to be submitted should be <innersource/[bugfix/feature/spike]/[name]>.
    * e.g. `innersource/feature/fancy_animations` or `innersource/bugfix/crash_on_my_device`
3. Modify the source on the branch
    * We are strong believers in Clean Code, but please focus on the specific change you are contributing!If you also reformat code, e.g. apply the 'boyscout principle', it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
    * If you have any structural change, please find our suggestion: please create a separate branch, and describe the intention for your changes in the pull request.
4. Mandatory: Ensure that local build and all the required test cases passes.
5. After completing the work, Rebase and then push the changes to Forked repository ( git push origin <your branch>).
6. Create Pull request to [review and merge code]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/git/pull-requests?view=vsts#from-the-code-view-on-the-web).
